### Course Description

Introduction to the design and implementation of programming languages: linguistic features for expressing algorithms; formal syntax specification; introduction to language semantics and parsing; declarative programming (functional and goal-driven); scripting languages; imperative programming (procedural and object-oriented); comparative design and implementation issues across languages and paradigms. Assignments emphasize languages such as Scheme, Prolog, Haskell, Python. Required Lab includes student presentations.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
* Identify and demonstrate risks to privacy in data science settings
* Define and apply formal notions of privacy, including k-anonymity and differential privacy
* Correctly match differential privacy technology with an application
* Safely implement privacy solutions, and experimentally validate the performance and utility of algorithms
* Understand differential privacy at a level sufficient to engage in research about best practices in implementation, apply the material in practice, and/or connect it to other areas

* Lecture notes for each chapter, in PowerPoint format, as well as some relevant supplemental materials will be posted on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.binghamton.edu/) before lectures. Lecture notes do not substitute for class attendance, since (i) they do not contain all the details in terms of explanations and analyses and (ii) significant parts of lectures, including discussions and presentations, may not come from the lecture notes
* Additional materials will be added as appropriate
