### Course Description

Introduction to the design and implementation of programming languages: linguistic features for expressing algorithms; formal syntax specification; introduction to language semantics and parsing; declarative programming (functional and goal-driven); scripting languages; imperative programming (procedural and object-oriented); comparative design and implementation issues across languages and paradigms. Assignments emphasize languages such as Scheme, Prolog, Haskell, Python. Required Lab includes student presentations.

### Learning Objectives

Develop computer science professionals who are knowledgeable consumers of programming languages, able to understand the strengths and limitations of languages and why the languages have them.

* Students will have a firm grasp of different language features included in common languages such as C, C++,C#, Java, Scheme, Prolog and scripting languages; understand the benefits and drawbacks of these features.
* Students will have a clear understanding of the different language paradigms, their benefits and drawbacks. Understand and appreciate the distinctions between imperative versus declarative languages; functional versus logic versus object-oriented languages.
* Students will understand how various language features are implemented, with a view to better understand design choices and trade-offs in a language, and most importantly, become more effective programmers whatever language you choose to program in.
* Students will acquire a good working knowledge of different programming styles and understand and use modern language features such as abstract data types, type-safe programming, inheritance, higher-order functions, etc.

* Lecture notes for each chapter, in PowerPoint format, as well as some relevant supplemental materials will be posted on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.binghamton.edu/) before lectures. Lecture notes do not substitute for class attendance, since (i) they do not contain all the details in terms of explanations and analyses and (ii) significant parts of lectures, including discussions and presentations, may not come from the lecture notes
* Additional materials will be added as appropriate
