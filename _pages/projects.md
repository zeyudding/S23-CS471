The goals of the presentation are 

1. Independent learning;
2. Team work;
3. Presentation experience with peer feedback.

Select a topic your team have limited experience with. Presentation and research should be done in teams of 2-4 students.  Presentations should be about 30 minutes.  Presentation material and written document are required.  The written document will include an abstraction of your talk, all references and a paragraph specifying what each member of your team contributed.   It should also address questions raised in the feedback you recieved. The written document will be between 2-5 pages double spaced.
You can include demo code if appropriate.
