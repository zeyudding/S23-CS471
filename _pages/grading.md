Your final grade is based on the following:

* Assignments (35%)
    * Two or three programming assignments in Scheme and Prolog.  Each programming assignment consists of short problems whose solutions require the understanding of how these languages work. 
        * Each programming assignment consists of several simple problems that require the student to understand declarative programming style of coding.
        * All programming assignments are an individual effort.  You may discuss homework problems, general strategies or algorithms with other students in the course, but you may not collaborate in the development of detail or actual writing of programs, e.g. you may NOT work from written notes developed collaboratively. Before turning in assignments, students may not look at other students’ code. If you run into a programming problem PLEASE keep a balance between receiving help in debugging and doing your own work.   It is your own responsibility to protect your work from unauthorized access. THE GOAL is for YOU to LEARN how to program using alternative programming paradigms 
    * Five or six written assignments related to programming language foundation.  Each assignment consists of short answers to questions.    
        * Understandability of the solutions is as necessary as correctness. Expect to lose points if you provide a badly written “correct” solution.  You are allowed to consult other books on homework, but you must cite your sources and write up your answers in such a way as to demonstrate that you understand the published solutions.

* Midterm Exams (30%)
    * There are two midterm exams which will be held during regular class time
* Final Exam (30%)
    * TBD by the University during the final exam week 
* Group Presentation (5%)
    * Students will select a topic to research and form teams of 2-4 students. Presentations will be scheduled during class or lab sessions.   Presentations should be around 30 minutes.  Each team will submit a 1-2 page abstraction of  presentation, references to all material used, and any presentation material. Each team member should have limited experience with the topic. 
    * Attendance for all presentations is required. Any unexcused absence from any presentation can result in a 2 point grade reduction from your final score.
    * Students must make a presentation to pass this course.

Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale which will be strictly followed.
